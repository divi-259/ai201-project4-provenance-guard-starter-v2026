# Acceptance criteria — Provenance Guard

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this service, written in unit 7
**before** you built it.

**All five are yours.** None are given.

An acceptance criterion names a number or something plainly observable. *"The
detector is accurate"* is an opinion — and perfect AI detection isn't possible
anyway, so it's an opinion about something nobody can deliver. *"Of 10 pieces I
wrote myself, at most 1 is labelled high-confidence AI"* is a criterion.

Under each, write a sentence or two on **why that target**. *"I allow at most 1
false positive in 10 because on a writing site a wrong accusation costs more
than a missed detection"* is a real answer.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## Pick numbers you can defend

**Cover at least three of these five areas.** They're prompts, not a form.

| Area | A question it could answer |
|---|---|
| False positives | How often may a human's writing get called AI? |
| Score spread | How far apart should clearly-AI and clearly-human text score? |
| Label coverage | Is every one of your three labels actually reachable? |
| The appeal path | Does an appeal always change status and always get recorded? |
| Bad input | What happens when `text` is missing, empty, or enormous? |

Two things worth knowing before you pick numbers:

- **The expensive mistake is one-sided.** Missing some AI text costs the site a
  little. Accusing a real writer costs that person a lot. A criterion that
  treats both errors as equally bad is describing a system nobody would ship.
- **Unit 8 tests across three trials, and the target has to hold across all
  three.** Your first signal runs a model, so identical input can score
  differently twice. A target of "at most 1 in 10" against trials of 2, 1, 2 is
  a **miss**.

## 1. My own writing is rarely called AI

Of 10 pieces I wrote myself, **at most 2** is labelled high-confidence AI, in
**every one** of the three trials.

**Why this target:** a wrong accusation is the expensive mistake on a writing
site. It costs a real person their credibility, while a missed AI piece costs
the site a little. Signal one is known to push plain writing toward "AI", so 2
in 10 is strict enough to matter but not so strict that the first ordinary
paragraph sinks it.

---

## 2. Clearly AI and clearly human text score far apart

The average final score of 5 clearly AI-generated texts is **at least 0.30
higher** than the average of 5 clearly human-written texts, in every trial.

**Why this target:** if the two groups score close together, the labels are
mostly noise, and any small wobble between trials flips them. A gap of 0.30 is
the width of my unsure band (0.35 – 0.65), so clear cases on each side can land
outside it instead of piling up in the middle.

---

## 3. All three labels are reachable

Of 9 inputs chosen to cover the range (3 clearly AI, 3 clearly human, 3
borderline), **each of the three labels appears at least once** in every trial.

**Why this target:** a label nobody can reach is a gap in the system, not a
design. A style signal that barely moves can quietly squeeze the final score
into the middle, so that "AI" or "human" never shows up. This criterion catches
that.

---

## 4. Every appeal is applied and recorded

For 5 appeals against real `content_id`s, **5 out of 5** change the
submission's status to "under review" **and** write an appeal entry to the
audit log. An appeal against a `content_id` that doesn't exist returns a 404
and is logged too.

**Why this target:** the appeal is the only protection a wrongly accused writer
has. If even one appeal silently does nothing, that person has been accused
with no way back. That's why the target is 100%, not "most".

---

## 5. Bad input is rejected cleanly

For 4 malformed requests (empty `text`, missing `text`, `text` set to null, and
`text` over 50,000 words), **all 4** return a 4xx status with a JSON error
message, **none** return a 500 or crash the service, and every rejection
appears in the audit log.

**Why this target:** bad input is cheap to send and the attack set will send
it. A 500 or a crash means one careless or hostile request can take the
service down for everyone.

     UNIT 8 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath, like this:

         ## 2. Uncertain cases land in the unsure band

         The system handles uncertain cases well.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 8:** Text I judged borderline scores between
         > 0.4 and 0.6 in at least 4 of 5 cases.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "well" gave me nothing to check. I couldn't
         > reach a verdict from it at all.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "At most 1 of 10 of my own pieces flagged as AI" → "at most 3
            of 10", because 1 of 10 turned out to be hard.

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
